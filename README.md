# Traffic Sign Recognition

## Project Description & Objective
Traffic sign recognition can help drivers in certain ways to increase the awareness of current road conditions and help imrpove safety 
by warning them to make sure the rules are not violated. For instance, recognizing speed limits, no entry signs or yield signs are 
just a few signs that can prove to be very important to keep the traffic safe. A front facing camera, scanning the road ahead, recognizes 
any sign and can take actions ranging from a warning on the instrument cluster, to even taking control of the cruising speed by 
automatically slowing down to make sure current speed isn't above limit. To make sign recognition possible, some machine learning methods 
are applied to train a model that can perform this recognition.

## Running the Project
This project was developed using Google Colab. Colab offers a flexible environment to develop projects where they are synchronized 
with user's Google acount and safely uploaded to Google Drive. However, perhaps the best offer is that it allows users to benefit from 
Google's GPUs to boost performance upon running the projects. This can save considerable amount of time especially when it comes to 
machine learning. That is why, this project only consists of a single Python notebook [trafficSigns.ipynb](trafficSigns.ipynb). After 
cloning this repository by running
```
git clone https://github.com/canozcivelek/traffic-sign-recognition.git
```
on the command prompt, the project is pretty much ready to go. If desired to run this project on Google Colab, make sure to have a Google 
account. Then by simply navigating to [colab.research.google.com], upload the project and run all the cells. More notes on  how the code 
works are provided in the next section.
